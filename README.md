# The-Perfect-Hello-World-Program
### This is a fun program to print "Hello World"

All of use "coders" have written a Hello World program in the early days of our learning. This is the PERFECT way to do that.

The code generates a random character, and does that until it gets the right one. Use sleep(1) and you can come back after binging a Season of Impractical Jokers.
